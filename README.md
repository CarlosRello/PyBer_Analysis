# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
 We will be creating some visual help to allow a better understanding on the correlation between the total weekly fares and the differences for each city type by creating a multiple-line graph that shows how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
## Results:
After reviewing the data we observe that there is a relation on the average fare paid and how developed the city is, that could be because in developed areas the distances to move around are generally smaller than in rural areas where distances usually are larger, that increase in average fare is usually compensated by the number of rides, Rural areas might have an average a higher fare per ride, but the amount of rides is just a fraction of the amount of Urban areas, this consideration proves to be true, since the suburban areas still have a bigger fare average than Urban areas, but still not as big as Rural, yet the income is greater than rural but not as big as Urban.

## Summary:
Usually there is an equilibrium between supply and demand in the use of this type of applications, where consumers can opt to another app or use the city cabs, this analysis would require some comparison with previous years and also against the market performance, we also might need to consider the level of satisfaction of consumers and drivers to be able to put in place some new decisions
